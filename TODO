--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ? portoctl resolve paths
- return EAGAIN from destroy/etc when can't wait for freezer (or remove freezer timeout altogether)
- PORTO_NAME - support namespaces
- bind: follow links instead of realpath (fails when target doesn't exist)
- ? respawn = true - respawn only if exit_status != 0
- add gc of dead containers with lost events
- support volume as root
- custom SIGTERM timeout (allow to send SIGKILL for such containers so we can 'force-destroy' them)
- kill master when can't restart slave many times

# threads
- add locks to GetChildrenSum
- check parent access in FindRunningParent, PrepareNetwork, IsNamespaceIsolated, CheckPausedParent, GetLeafCgroup, GetPortoNamespace

# root property
- mount root loop in root namespace (to better diagnose possible problems)
- do not use loop mountpoint for stdio files (conflicts with previous)

# 3.18
- enable user namespace for virt_mode=os

# kernel
- ? kernel support for cgroup to limit allowed ports
- ? kernel support for cgroup coredump path

# volume api
- add stresstest

# cleanup
- move all 'extern "C"' into one file
- use some kind of reference count for accounting running children
- add c++ namespaces
- ? get rid of globals/static which have class types (http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#Static_and_Global_Variables)
- open std files earlier and do dup2 before exec

# key-value refactor
- use one key-value storage for containers and volumes
- write to key-value using create-rename instead of merge
- repace uint16_t identifiers with something bigger
